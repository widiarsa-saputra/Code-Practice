Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

### Example
`["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...]` --> `["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]`

None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
